# Frontend Mentor - Typemaster pre-launch landing page

## Solution Description

A responsive landing page built using HTML and vanilla CSS.

### Challenges

The biggest challenge was working with background images again, but I will continue learning more about this topic. Secondly, transitioning from full-bleed to padded content on smaller screens was also challenging. I'm not sure if I approached it the best way, but I removed my container class on smaller screens and added padding where needed.
